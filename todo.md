# Issues:
This is a big issue with the code:
it runs way too fast, on the rpi 5 it runs at ~ 2600 fps
with the sense hat emulator it runs ~ 240 fps
because of this issue it has a kind of screen tearing so bad that it will only desplay the player with some weird glitches in the pixels,

i need lots of help with this issue.


# Todo:
add player control

add movement testing functionality

Update movement for enemys so that it wont goo to fast, also the player movement will have to be ajusted to that also.
