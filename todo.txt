Issues:
This is a big issue with the code:
it runs way too fast, on the rpi 5 it runs at ~ 2600 fps
with the sense hat emulator it runs ~ 240 fps
because of this issue it has a kind of screen tearing so bad that it will only desplay the player with some weird glitches in the pixel
i need lots of help with this.


Todo:
add player control
add movement testing
